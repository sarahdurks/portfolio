### User Story 📖
> AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications

> WHEN I view the header      
> THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio      
> WHEN I view the navigation titles      
> THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted      
> WHEN I click on a navigation title      
> THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted      
> WHEN I load the portfolio the first time      
> THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
